Hi There

Installation:
assuming you are on the root of the project and you have a linux like terminal available:
1- cd server , npm install
2- cd ..
3- cd frontend , npm install

Testing:
 npm test 
on each of folders server or frontend will run the tests

running:

you will need 2 terminals one for server and one for frontend.
 in each of the terminals cd to the folder ( like cd server or cd frontend )
and run:
npm start.

there will be logs showing in the log file for server.
Also in the browser you should be able to see more logs by enabling log level debug(verbose)
in case you got a question while running fe, just press Y

Credentials:

for demo reasons use

user: user
pass: password
